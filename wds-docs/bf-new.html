<h2>A BRILLIANT PRODUCT AND WORLD PREMIERE</h2>
<p>The star product of the company: BUDDY is the first robot companion made accessible to the greatest number of people not only for playing, learning and interaction, but also for home monitoring and day-to- day assistance.
Entirely developed and manufactured in France by BLUE FROG ROBOTICS and its partners, 1500 robots have already been pre-ordered. BUDDY will be available by Christmas 2017 at a recommended retail price of € 1290, supported by a wide range of applications and accessories.
Through strategic partnerships, BUDDY also targets the professional market in the education, hospitality, handicap and smart home industries. Some 20 robots are currently being experimented in welcoming and entertaining iDTGV train passengers. A close collaboration has also been formed with the Institut Medico-Educatif (IME) « Papillons blancs ». BUDDY can now be integrated in a connected home thanks to a partnership with SOMFY, the smart home expert.

Bruno Bonnell will take part in BLUE FROG ROBOTICS’s strategic plan all while providing his expertise in the leisure and education software, consumer robotics service product, and innovative company financing fields. Both founders and inventors of the BUDDY robot, Rodolphe Hasselvander, CEO, and Franck de Visme, COO, will be maintaining their operational functions and overall control of the company.
