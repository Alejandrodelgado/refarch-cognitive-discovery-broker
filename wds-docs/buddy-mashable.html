<h2>Rolling Buddy robot may just kill you with cuteness</h2>
Buddy is stuffed with features. It can speak and hear, sense its environment and navigate a room. He can also recognize faces, play games with children, watch over your home, manage your calendar and set alarms, and detect smoke and fire.

In addition, Buddy is a telepresence robot that will even let you remotely see through its built-in camera, act as a smart home companion and according to Blue Frog Robotics, connect to and control other smart home devices. He'll let you make Skype calls and deliver messages sent to it via a Buddy app, too.

For many of these tasks, Blue Frog Robotics developed a series a super-cute expressions — although I question the one that shows Buddy looking like's asleep during guard duty — which appear on the 1280x800 screen. All of this should help the little robot become a more accepted companion in the home. Blue Frog estimates the robot will have 8 to 10 hours of battery life.

Like other startup robots, Buddy will be open source and the company will offer an SDK so developers can add and remove applications and develop new ones for the companion bot.

BlueFrog Robotics COO Franck de Visme told Mashable it is accessible to developers based on commonly-used tools like C++, C# and JavaScript. "Buddy will be 80% open source at the beginning and then later on 100%," he wrote in an email, adding that the accessibility relates to pricing, too (Buddy starts at $749).

Blue Frog Robotics plans to deliver Buddy in May of 2016, something that seems like a distinct possibility now that Buddy's Indiegogo campaign blew through its $100,000 goal in a matter of hours. In the campaign, Buddy was listed for $649 for the Classic Edition and Toolkit. Meanwhile, a developer’s edition (arriving in December of this year) sold for $599 on the campaign ($749 retail).
