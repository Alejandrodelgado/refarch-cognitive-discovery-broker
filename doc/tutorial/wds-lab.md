# Building a Discovery Service for Weather data

IBM Watson Discovery Service (WDS) is a Watson service that provides the developers the ability to rapidly add a cognitive, search and content analytics engine to application to identify patterns, trends and insights that drive better decision making.
The purpose of this section is to show how to set up and configure Watson Discovery Service and how to inject document about weather management like hurricane. Watson Discovery Service is only available on Bluemix.
Once created WDS instance allows you to ingest (convert, enrich, clean, normalize), store and query data to extract actionable insights.

You can create and configure a Discovery service instance by using either the Discovery Tooling or the Discovery API. In the beginning of this tutorial we are using the Discovery Tooling.

This labs is organized in layers to address different skill set.

The labs files used for creating collection of documents are under the wds-docs folder.
